        <h2>ArchieUI - WEB enabled robot and Smart home control</h2>
        </p>
        <p>The development of this WEB application is carried out as part of the effort for obtaining the degree of
            Doctor
            technicae (Dr. techn.),</p>

        <strong>
            <P>under the supervision of</P>
            <p> Em.O.Univ.Prof. Dipl.-Ing. Dr.techn. Dr.h.c.mult. Peter Kopacek</p>

            <br><br>
            <p>The main goal of this application is to provide a simple to use, user friendly interface for the service
                robot Archie, opposed to the scientific research focused (technical) interfaces usually being developed.
            </p>

            <p>ArchieUI is an open source WEB application, used to control the cost-oriented humanoid robot Archie,
                being developed at the Technische Universit√§t Wien (TU Wien).</p>

            <p>In addition to the robot control, ArchieUI provides access to a Smart home server and other IoT sensors
                and actuators in the
                users home environment.
            </p>
            <p>ArchieUI application has  Mobile Responsive Design, built in voice control and ease of access features, thus it can be used
                for carring out usability research (in real or simulated environment) with elderly and disabled persons,
                also providing remote access and control to their relatives over the Internet.</p>
            <br>
            <p> ArchieUI was developed to control the Archie robot, but it can be used with any other ROS (Robot
                Operating System) enabled robot (or simulated ROS robot)</p>

            <p> by changing the ROS topics it uses, or just relaying the topics of the other robot to Archie topics,
                using topic_tools package. </p>
            <br>
            <p>The ArchieUI application is available at githib for the roboticists socsiety,</p>
            <p>to use and modify in the way they need it for their research! </p>
